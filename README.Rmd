The goal of the refinery package is to provide tools that make it easier to blog reproducibly using distill. The central idea is to associate every post with a unique R environment, using the renv package to ensure that each post is rendered using its associated environment. It is not yet on CRAN, and may never be, but if you are foolish enough to try out the dev version despite the near-total lack of documentation, unit tests, or anything else that you'd expect of a functioning package...

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("djnavarro/refinery")
```

To the extent that documentation exists, you can find it on the package website:
